# 0x19. Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Project Issue

## Issue Summary

Our web application experienced a significant outage from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM EST on November 10, 2023. During this period, the user registration service was unavailable, resulting in a 50% decrease in user sign-ups. The impact extended to our marketing team as they were unable to acquire new users during this time, leading to a 20% decrease in user acquisition rate.

## Timeline

| Time | Description |  
| --- | --- |  
| **10:00 AM EST** | Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating high error rates on the user registration service. |  
| **10:01 AM EST** | Engineering team was alerted and began investigating the issue |  
| **10:15 AM EST** | Root cause suspected to be a memory leak in the user registration service |  
| **10:30 AM EST** | Memory leak confirmed and mitigation measures implemented |  
| **10:45 AM EST** | User registration service restored to normal operation |  
| **11:00 AM EST** | Incident resolved |  

## Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the outage was a memory leak in the user registration service. The memory leak was caused by a bug in the service's code that resulted in memory not being released after it was no longer needed. This led to a gradual increase in memory usage over time, eventually causing the service to become unresponsive.

The issue was resolved by implementing a fix in the service's code to correctly manage memory. This involved identifying and fixing the bug that was causing the memory leak. After the fix was implemented, the memory usage of the service returned to normal levels.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future, we need to improve our testing and code review processes. Specifically, we should:

- Implement more rigorous unit testing for our services to catch memory leaks and other bugs earlier in the development process.
- Conduct more thorough code reviews to catch potential issues before they result in outages.

Specific tasks to address this issue include:

- Patch the user registration service with the memory management fix.
- Add more comprehensive unit testing for the user registration service.
- Conduct a thorough code review of the user registration service's code.
- Update our incident response plan to include procedures for handling memory leaks.
